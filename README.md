## The Golden Rule: 

ü¶∏ ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è `Stop starting and start finishing.` üèÅ

If you work on more than one feature at a time, you are guaranteed to multiply your bugs and your anxiety.

## Making a plan

HTML
1) Make divs for selection, displaying images, slogan input, displaying stats, and displaying slogans
2) create dropdown selection options
3) make headings for each dropdown option

JS
1) Create createCountString(type, count) test in tests.js 
2) Import
3) grab DOM elements with getElementById()
4) let state of counters and arrays
5) add event listeners for the dropdowns
6) function to createCountString
7) function to displayStats
8) event listener for slogans
9) function to display slogans 

CSS
1) layout for the various HTML elements
2) additional styling as needed

Additional considerations:
- Ask: which of your HTML elements need to be hard coded, and which need to be dynamically generated?
- Consider your data model. 
  - What kinds of objects (i.e., Dogs, Friends, Todos, etc) will you need? 
  - What are the key/value pairs? 
  - What arrays might you need? 
  - What needs to live in a persistence layer?
- Is there some state we need to initialize?
- Ask: should any of this work be abstracted into functions? (i.e., is the work complicated? can it be resused?)
